            <p className='about-us__paragraph-main'>With the world of personal investing becoming ever more prevalent, the use of tools that allow you to observe and manage your assets has skyrocketed.
                While this is a great thing, there is still an issue that is preventing a large population from ever learning more. This issue is the wide adoption of subscription based services.
                We believe at BlueWatch that we can make a difference by making a free, approachable, scalable, and user friendly site for everyone.
